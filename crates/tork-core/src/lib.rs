//! Core runtime for the Tork web framework.
//!
//! This crate holds everything that runs at request time: the HTTP server built
//! on Hyper and Tokio, the router, the dependency-injection traits, response and
//! error types. It contains no procedural macros; those live in `tork-macros`.
//!
//! End users do not depend on this crate directly. They depend on the `tork`
//! facade crate, which re-exports the public surface defined here.
